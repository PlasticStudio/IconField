![IconField](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlasticStudio/IconField/master/screenshot.jpg)

# Requirements

- SilverStripe 4 or 5

# Version
- Use release 1 for legacy non-cms editable icon files
- Use release 2 updated icon files managed in CMS Files area

# Migration

If migrating from release 1 to 2:
- update IconFields to use new source path, eg `IconField::create('SocialIcon', 'Icon', 'SiteIcons')`
- create new folders in CMS Files area based on IconField set up, eg `SiteIcons`
- upload and publish icons
- run task `IconFieldPathMigrator_BuildTask` for each class that has been updated
- make sure to add params `?class=Skeletor\DataObjects\SummaryPanel&field=SVGIcon`
- if your new folder is not 'SiteIcons', add this to the params as well, eg `&new-path=NewFolder`
- lastly, remove the icon folder from client/assets

# Usage

- Import the required classes:

```
use PlasticStudio\IconField\Icon;
use PlasticStudio\IconField\IconField;
```

- Set your `$db` field to type `Icon` (eg `'PageIcon' => Icon::class`)
- `IconField::create($name, $title, $folderName)`
  - `$name` is the database field as defined in your class
  - `$title` is the label for this field
  - `$folderName` is the name of the folder inside the Assets, nested folders are allowed

- Use your icon in templates as you would any other property (eg `$PageIcon`). If your icon is an SVG, the SVG image data will be injected into the template. To prevent this, you can call `$PageIcon.IMG` instead to enforce use of `<img>` tags.

- Add a default width and height to the config.yml file to output width/height attributes on image tags, e.g. `<img width="30" height="30" />`. This is good for SEO.

```
PlasticStudio\IconField\IconField:
  default_width: "30"
  default_height: "30"
```
